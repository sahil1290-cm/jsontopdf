# GPT-3 & Next.js - PDF to JSON Converter (Custom Schema)

This project demonstrates how to extract structured JSON data from PDFs using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API. It's a lightweight but powerful utility to automate PDF parsing for use in applications like data analysis, reporting, or backend workflows.

### ✅ Built by Sahil 

As part of my Tech Virtual Assistant portfolio, this app reflects my ability to work with APIs, automate manual processes, and integrate AI models into real-world tools.
